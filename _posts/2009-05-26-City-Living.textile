It is ridiculous that my City Living has made me so numb I keep working outside when I hear a drive by shooting.

Last night I was out working in the yard and heard the shots. They were not close enough for me to stop working. Five or so years ago I would have stopped what I was doing, called 911. and would go off off to see what the neighbors were doing about it.
